# Cross-Chain NFT Minting Demo

A demonstration of cross-chain NFT minting using thirdweb Engine, where users can send ETH on any supported chain and receive an NFT on Optimism Sepolia.

## Overview

This application showcases a seamless cross-chain minting experience where users can:
1. Connect their wallet
2. Select from multiple supported chains (Base Sepolia, Optimism Sepolia, etc.)
3. Send 0.001 ETH on their chosen chain
4. Automatically receive an NFT on Optimism Sepolia
5. Track the entire process through real-time notifications

## How It Works

1. **Wallet Connection**
   - User connects their wallet using thirdweb's Connect Button
   - Application loads balances for all supported chains

2. **Chain Selection**
   - User can select from any supported chain where they have balance
   - Uses thirdweb's Network Switcher Modal for seamless network switching
   - Chains with 0 balance are automatically disabled

3. **Payment Process**
   - User initiates minting by clicking "Mint"
   - Application prepares a transaction to send 0.001 ETH
   - Transaction is sent using thirdweb's sendTransaction

4. **NFT Minting**
   - After payment confirmation, backend is notified via API call
   - Backend triggers NFT minting on Optimism Sepolia
   - User receives real-time updates via toast notifications

5. **Confirmation**
   - User receives confirmation with block explorer link
   - NFT is viewable on Optimism Sepolia
